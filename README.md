## Motivation

Lately, I've been struggling with "time management" as the number of tasks is always bigger than the amount of time we have on our hands, therefore in order to achieve maximum efficiency it's crucial to prioritize in a deterministic matter.

My model implies only 2 factors (for simplicity's sake) 
  1. I = Importance (biggest impact) 📢
  2. U = Urgency (cannot postpone) 🔥

<b>where P = U + I.</b>

With that in mind, I've built a simple prioritization tool called "Get Shit Done", which is designed to be used first thing in the morning to get your "brain dump" and prioritization straight.

I've been using it for the past week or so, and it really helped me to get my schedule straight.
   
### Warnings    

1. I need this tool for myself, meaning, there might be some glitches, bugs or UI improvements - do let me know I'd like to improve the tool.

2.  I don't know if this is "THE BEST" model, but it is "A GOOD ENOUGH" model which worked for me. Feel free to open a discussion on its effectiveness.

3. The tool is open source, feel free to PR, Issue or help with the design.

4. If you find it useful, do share and let me know
